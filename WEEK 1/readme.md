# linear transformation

bias vector concept

changes in expected value when-
- we shift all databpoints by some fixed constant 
- we multiply all datapoints by some fixed constant(scaling factor)

changes in variance when-
- we shift all datapoints by some fixed constant
- we multiply all datapoints by some fixed constant
